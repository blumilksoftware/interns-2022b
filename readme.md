| Command         | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `composer cs`   | Runs codestyle against the package itself                    |
| `composer csf`  | Runs codestyle with fixer enabled against the package itself |
| `composer test` | Runs all test cases                                          |

#### Running with Docker

There is the Docker Compose configuration available:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php php -v
docker-compose exec php composer -V
```

We encourage you to register an alias in your `~./bash_aliases`:

```
alias dcr='docker-compose run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)"'
```

Then following command could be handy:

```shell
dcr php php -v
dcr php php cmd/run.php
dcr php composer -V
dcr php composer test
```
